# A simple readme

Change stuff, push, pull, edit, merge, mess everything up and learn!

Once you get a handle of managing editing this one file, make another and
push it up. See how that works. This repo is to learn git!

My cat is a hamburgaler. From hamburg. He's also fat. We call him fat cat. Heh.
He is also a rich cat. Which makes fat cat a pun. That rhymes with hamburger bun.

I'm going to add more changes, yeah!
